The MP/M II disks for the Altos 8000 have been lost to time. In order
to get MP/M II onto the Altos 8000 I am attempting to start with the
official DRI release, and am using the Altos 8000 XIOS listing from
the [MP/M II System Implementor's Guide](http://www.bitsavers.org/pdf/digitalResearch/mpm_II/MPM_II_System_Implementors_Guide_Aug82.pdf).
